### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space


**Week Three** 

After lots of struggle, I managed to get my raindrop looking somewhat normal. After crit, Phoebe had said that the way it was drawing was uncanny, because the perspective s from the side, but the raindrop was staying the same size, so it looked odd. It was always in my plan to scale it, making it smaller to thhe bottom, because it did look weird without it. I also want to see about adding a shadow for the water drop in behind the actual drop, although I'm not sure how I will manage that.

I've also played around a bit with the colour palette, and make it a bit more ple and quiet, because I felt that the shadows and highlights were a bit too harsh on one another. I still might try to mess around with the colours a bit more, because4 I want it to be convincing. I do know that there is a point where I will have to stop though, because I will overdo it if given the chance.
