### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space
EXAMPLE README 

My design for ths project will water rippling. I want to use pixel art for the aesthetic for it, because I think this could work quite well with how I am imagining the final outcome. I feel that I might have a bit of difficulty with the plan I currently have, but I feel lke I can make it work and look really good.
