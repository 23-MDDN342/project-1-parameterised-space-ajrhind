### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space


**Week Three** 

Last week I was tryinhg to get a for loop working for the ripple. I got it kind of working, but the postioning seemed wrong, and I couldn't figure out the logic needed for it to be able to do what I want. So I've gone back to my original bunch of ellipses. 

This week I'm going to try make it more 3d, and put more realism into it. I'm gonna add in some more shadows and highlights, and then get the water drop in there. I dont think that will be a difficult task, so I'm leaving it for last.


*ALS NOTES FOR THE NEXT CLASS*
Make sure to make the inside shadow ellipse, i think need to just half the first shadow map. Then u need to make the stroke rlly thick and make it a darker blue than the background. Could do this a few times w slight changews to the colour but who knows yet. You also need to do the water drop this class so its in the right position and you can get phoebe to help.

also need ot fix the different sizes scale cos thts not working properly
