### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space


#### Creative Coding III/MDDN342
## Final ReadMe
#### Alanah Rhind
#### Project One - Parameterised Space

This is my final outcome of my Creative Coding class. 

The brief stated we need to create an ambient repeating background for a Zoom meeting using P5.js. My first thought was to make something soothing and easy to look at. It also had to loop without a seam, so I landed on the idea of a water drop and ripple. It's a natural repeating pattern, so I came to conclusion it would be a good one to do, and it would match the brief perfectly.

I made this ripple effect using arcs, strokeWeight, and a good colour palette. I used around 7 different colours for the palette, trying to make it look as smooth and blended as I could. Using the arcs made it so I could make a more convincing highlights and lowlights. I also put the strokeWeight into maps and made it scale with the position or the arcs, making it larger when moving out, and added some depth to the code.
