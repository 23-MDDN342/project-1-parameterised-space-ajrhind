### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space


**Week Two** 

After getting my simple water ripple loop working, I'm thinking about different ways I could do it. I thought about making a for loop, with lots of ellipses with a heavy stroke, and then when there is a water drop, they will bounce up and down, and change colour. I think this could be quite difficult though, as  would need to have a delay at the start for the water drop. I also have no idea how I would make each ellipes stroke bounce up and down to make the illusion of a ripple. If I can't manage to do it, I think I might just take the drop out all together, and make it just a really smooth illusion.
