### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space


**Week Three** 

Last week I was tryinhg to get a for loop working for the ripple. I got it kind of working, but the postioning seemed wrong, and I couldn't figure out the logic needed for it to be able to do what I want. So I've gone back to my original bunch of ellipses. 

This week I'm going to try make it more 3d, and put more realism into it. I'm gonna add in some more shadows and highlights, and then get the water drop in there. I dont think that will be a difficult task, so I'm leaving it for last.


*ALS NOTES FOR THE NEXT CLASS*
I don't think u need to do the inside shadow part, could try, i dont know if it would look natural or not. I also need to make the shadows and highlights pop more, cos rn it looks very flat. Fix the raindrop too, looks jank rn. 

also need ot fix the different sizes scale cos thts not working properly
