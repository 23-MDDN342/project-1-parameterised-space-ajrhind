### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space

My design for ths project will water rippling. I want to use pixel art for the aesthetic for it, because I think this could work quite well with how I am imagining the final outcome. I feel that I might have a bit of difficulty with the plan I currently have, but I feel lke I can make it work and look really good.

I've been trying to play around with my ripple idea, but I'm not quite sure how I'm going to make it work. I'm thinking I could slightly change my idea, and make it an optical illusion of sorts, in the same kind of view as the ripples would be. I also think it would look cool to still do a ripple, but do it from side on, and using ovals instead of plain ellipses.
